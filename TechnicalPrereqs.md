# Technical Prerequisites

This is an evolving list of technical (i.e. non-physics) information which I think will be useful. U
nfortunately as well as knowing lots of physics you also have to have a pretty broad knowledge of coding, installing and compiling software, UNIX platforms etc.

## How we do physics
In my experience, most physical science research nowadays involved developing or using various different computer programmes, including writing one's own instructions for the computer.
Really the only way to do this is to have a command-line-interface (CLI): some kind of "terminal" which allows us to write text-based instructions which tell the computer what to do.
Nearly everybody uses UNIX-based operating systems, which is why you will see everyone in the HEP department generally using Macs or Linux-based operating systems: it's just easier to do everything.

Windows has as terminal called PowerShell, which is the same idea.
However, it's probably best to set up a Linux environment, and I think the best solution is `Windows Subsystem for Linux` (looks a lot easier than trying to set such things up on Windows a decade ago...). 
This looks like a good video to follow to set it up: [WSL Instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYlgUDKKK5A)
