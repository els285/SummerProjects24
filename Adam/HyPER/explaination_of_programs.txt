Adam_parse_ROOT
- follows Han's HyPER tutorial for converting a root file into an h5 file, but uses batching to avoid memory issues for large files

Adam_parse_ROOT_numpy
- same as above, but uses a numpy method rather than a for loop. This is about 3.5 times faster than the method above
- this doesn't use the same dtype labels, so this could be a problem. I seem to remember you saying that HyPER just uses the position, not the labels

create_hyer.py
- creates an h5 file in the from the raw data.
- delta R matches to find jet_match
- works for all had for 4 top and ttbar (just need to set the new_values)

lepton case
- jupyter notebook of the ttbar single lepton with some steps explained

create_hyper_ttbar_sing_lep_h5
- python file to convert root to h5 for ttbar single lepton (very limited comments so good luck)
