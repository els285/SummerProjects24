# Machine Learning Stuff 

## HEP ML Tutorial
Here is the official HSF tutorial which I think gives a good introduction to classification using PyTorch:
[https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-ml-webpage/]https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-ml-webpage/)

You are meant to run this in a Kaggle Jupyter notebook by making a Kaggle account (maybe this is of intrest to you anyway).
The tutorial will definitely work that way.
If you want to do it on your own machine, give it a try: I've uploaded the datasets I think you need to the Google Drive in [this subdirectory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MXqiK9E-uVTh8K2_Y8-r98InRAQBUrvJ).

Many other cool tutorials from a Summer School I didn't get to go to because of Covid (more complex):

## Converting ROOT data
The default file format for machine learning is `.h5`, so the first thing one
has to do is convert ROOT files to this format. A very short example notebook is
included `example_ROOT2h5.ipynb`.
